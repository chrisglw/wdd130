    <h2>Christian Landaverde</h2>
    <p>I am studying computer science. I really like to work out, and I like to
        explore other places (I just do not like the traveling part.) </p>
    <p>I also like to
        take photos and videos of whatever I think is cool.</p>
    <p>I am a convert in the church, and
        my favorite scripture is Ether 12:27 because I definitely had a lot of weaknesses
        before becoming member of the church or even before believing there is a God.
        This scripture helped me understand that if I humble to God, he will make weak things
        become strong. </p>
